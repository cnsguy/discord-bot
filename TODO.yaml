general:
  - drop unnecessary 1:1 database mapping wherever applicable
  - maybe replace channel.send stuff with early construction of CommandInteraction + separate args param

bugs?:
  - reminder: repeating reminders will only get sent once even if the interval has passed multiple times since the bot was last running
